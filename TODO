How to support reviews 

Requirements, arguments and counter arguments are all subject to review. A review is a map that associates ranges of text
in the reviewed document with (review) text. As it is often the case that the authors will want to reply to the comments
we may improve the model by mapping ranges of text to discussions. A discussion is a sequence of text messages that contain in 
addition to the comment, the author of the comment and the date on which it was created. 

We may represent reviews as XML documents. 

Another option is to represent all documents with XML and then a review could be added to the document itself. For example

<discussion>
<comment author="Alice" date="10/3/24">suggestion: the comment's author (more concise)</comment>
<comment author="Bob" date="12/3/24">yes, that's a good idea.</comment>
</discussion> and the date on which it was created.</p>
